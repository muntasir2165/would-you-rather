# Would You Rather: A React Redux App

This is the finished app for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

The app utilizes React, Redux and associated concepts in the framework to design and develop a "front-end only" Would You Rather game application . The back-end is simulated using the [_DATA.js](./src/utils/_DATA.js) file.
